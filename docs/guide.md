# How to do your own home energy assessment

This guide walk's through doing your own home energy assessment for working out to begin with where energy is lost in your home and then for working out the effect of carrying out home energy efficiency measures such as external wall insulation, installing higher performance windows or changing a heating system.

It makes use of the online free to use, open source energy assessment software weve been developing here as a collaboration between OpenEnergyMonitor and Carbon Coop.

## Measuring up your home

Start by drawing a floor plan of your house, this could be on paper or using a program such as paint, open office draw or a CAD package. Draw an indication of wall widths and include internal walls.

Measure each wall dimension without initially taking into account the window's and doors, place the dimention on the floorplan. 

Draw the windows and doors on the floor plan and note each windows width and height.

Label each room and note the room height.

Here's an example floor plan, showing wall dimensions, windows and room heights:

Start in the top-left corner and work clockwise labelling each external wall with a unique name: E1, E2, E3 etc

Then do the same for the windows.

### Calculate floor areas: 

Calculate the area of each floor not inculding internal walls of each floor, enter each floor in the floor section of the calculator.

In our example here there are two floors each 6 meters by 8 meters and 2.5m high:
